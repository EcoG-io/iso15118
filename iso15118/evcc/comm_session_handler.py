"""
This module contains the EVCC's CommunicationSessionHandler class as well as
its EVCCCommunicationSession class. The former is used to initiate the EVCC
and handle the SDP (SECC Discovery Protocol) exchange with the EVCC, which - if
successful - will result in spawning up an EVCCCommunicationSession object.
That EVCCCommunicationSession object is taking care of the TCP communication
with the SECC to properly exchange all messages in a V2G communication session.

        Initiates a new SECC Discovery Protocol (SDP) request message, which the
        EVCC sends to the SECC via UDP.

        The SDP messages are sent via UDP and the EVCC expects an SDP response
        from the SECC within 250 ms. If the EVCC runs into a timeout, it will
        send another SDP request. Up to 49 retries (50 SDP requests in total)
        are allowed before the SDP is deemed unsuccessful. As a result,
        the ISO 15118 communication cannot proceed and the EV would have to
        fall back to analog PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) based charging.

        The constant SDP_MAX_REQUEST_COUNTER is used to compare the current
        SDP request counter with the maximum allowed number of SDP requests in
        one go (50).

        However, once SDP was successful and the ISO 15118 communication
        proceeds, an error can occur later while processing one of the messages.
        It is up to the car manufacturer to decide how many times the EV should
        try to restart the communication, starting with the SDP. The rationale
        here is that this same error might not occur twice (maybe there was an
        unfortunate bit flip, for example).

        For restarting an SDP, we use the SDP_RETRY_CYCLES setting in the
        evcc_settings.py file. One SDP_RETRY_CYCLE can send up to 50 SDP
        consecutive requests before the cycle is over.
