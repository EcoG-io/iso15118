    loop.getaddrinfo returns a list of tuples containing

    As we need an IPv6 address, we can filter out all IPv4 addresses
    with getaddrinfo by specifying the family type with AF_INET6
    (instead of AF_INET). Additionally, filtering the socket type for
    TCP (by looking for socket.SOCK_STREAM) will yield just one list entry.

    In this case we will get one entry that will look like
    [ (<AddressFamily.AF_INET6: 30>, <SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM: 1>, 6, '',
    ('fe80::4fd:9dc8:b138:3bcc', 65334, 0, 5)) ]

    loop.getaddrinfo is the async version of socket.getaddrinfo
    Check https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.getaddrinfo

    Socket_address is equal to e.g. ('fe80::4fd:9dc8:b138:3bcc', 65334, 0, 5)

    interface.
