    The UDPServer makes use of asyncio and its concepts of 'transports' and
    'protocols'. A transport is an abstraction for a socket
    (how bytes are transmitted), while the protocol determines which bytes to
    transmit (and to some extent when).

    There is always a 1:1 relationship between transport and protocol objects:
    the protocol calls transport methods to send data, while the transport
    calls protocol methods to pass it data that has been received.

    asyncio implements transports for TCP, UDP, SSL, and subprocess pipes.
    We use asyncio.DatagramTransport for UDP.
